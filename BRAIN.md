# BRAIN.md — How Tabby's brain & memory work

Tabby has **two brains** and **persistence**. One brain decides what she *does*
(`brain.py`); the other decides what she *says*, remembers, and learns
(`chatter.py`). Both adapt over time. This doc is the faithful reference.

## What Tabby does (at a glance)

- **Reacts to Claude Code** — runs while tools run, follows subagents, cheers on
  success, gets startled by errors, perks up at questions, looks proud at end.
- **Lives on her own when idle** — wanders, sits, naps, zoomies, plays, grooms,
  curious/grumpy — chosen by her drives, not scripted.
- **Has needs you tend** — hungry (begs), lonely (seeks you), tired (sleeps),
  scared (cowers). **Left-click** = pet (consoles when scared); **right-click** =
  Feed/Pet/Sleep/Quit; **hover** = status panel (doing + drive bars + bond %).
- **Talks** — short cat-like lines in a bubble.
- **Learns you** — affection grows; she forms confidence-weighted impressions;
  behaviour adapts to what earns your attention; she leans on the API less over time.

## 1. Behaviour brain — `brain.py`

A **homeostatic drive model** with learning on top.

### Drives
| drive  | start | drift/s            | urgent ≥ | high → | reset by |
|--------|-------|--------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| energy | 70    | per-behaviour      | —        | sleep  | resting |
| hunger | 20    | +0.12 (+more on exertion) | 78 | beg | feed (−85) |
| social | 20    | +0.08              | 72       | seek   | pet (−30) |
| fear   | 0     | −0.6 (decays)      | 60       | cower  | console (−55) |

### Mood inertia (B1)
`valence` (pleasant↔unpleasant) and `arousal` (calm↔excited) are EWMA-smoothed
(rate 0.1) from the drives. Urgent drives name the mood directly
(scared/hungry/lonely); otherwise mood comes from smoothed valence/arousal
(sleepy / playful / content) so labels don't flicker on a threshold.

### Behaviour selection (per tick)
1. Update drives; **fear spike interrupts** → `cower`.
2. At a behaviour's end, choose next:
   - **Urgent drive wins** (fear > hunger > social). While scared, hunger/social
     urgency thresholds are **raised +20** so fear takes priority (B3).
   - Else weighted-random:
     `weight = base · _factor(energy, active_hour) · (0.7 + 0.6·affinity) · recent_penalty`
     - `_factor` biases by energy and by **user activity hour** (B5): naps cluster
       in your quiet hours, livelier when you're usually around.
     - `affinity` (B2): learned per-behaviour preference (below).
     - `recent_penalty` (B6): 0.15 just-used, decays to 1.0 over ~30s (history of last 4).
3. Scripted wake-up: `sleep → stretch → sit`. Finishing groom/sleep/stretch gives a
   small **contentment** valence bump (B3).

### Idle flavour & presence (B)
Beyond the core set, idle adds `loaf / knead / ponder / watch` (all reuse existing
sprites). And `_notice_cursor` (UI): when the mouse comes near her on the taskbar
she turns to face it and perks up (`watch`) — a light, no-extra-UI way to feel the
human's presence. She holds still while a quiz card is on screen.

### Learning & lifelike state
- **Behaviour reinforcement (B2):** `affinity` per behaviour (EWMA 0.20, bounded
  [0.2, 1.0]). Pet/feed while doing X raises X's affinity; a scare lowers the
  current one. Bounds keep innate traits dominant — no behaviour monoculture.
- **Trust + sensitization (B4):** `trust` (init 0.30) dampens fear spikes
  `effective_scare = amount·(1−0.5·trust)·(1+jumpiness)`. Consoling raises trust;
  un-consoled scares erode it. `jumpiness` rises +0.25/scare (error storms make her
  progressively jumpy) and decays ~0.03/s.
- **User rhythm (B5):** a 24-bucket `active_hours` histogram, incremented on every
  interaction, drives the activity-hour bias above.

### Interactions (from the mascot)
`feed()` hunger−85 + reinforce + note-active; `receive_pet()` social−30, consoles
if fear>35 (fear−55, trust+0.1) else fear−8, + reinforce; `scare(amount, trigger)`
applies trust/jumpiness then cowers; `force_sleep()` caps energy at 25.

### Expanded fear triggers (Phase 4)
`scare()` takes a `trigger` label and records `last_fear_trigger`/`last_fear_effective`
so the mascot can log a telemetry `fear` event. The mascot's `_fear_trigger()` maps
Claude-state transitions to small, trust/shyness/comfort-damped spikes — beyond the
original `tool_failure`:
- **error_storm** — ≥3 `tool_failure`s within 25s → a bigger spike (jumpiness already
  escalates repeated scares); recovers as successes return.
- **permission** — a permission prompt unsettles, escalating if repeated.
- **activity_spike** — first activity after >30min idle makes a still-jumpy cat
  flinch once, then curiosity takes over.
- **neglect** — >24h with no attention nudges mild anxiety + bumps `social` so she
  seeks you (checked ~every 2min in the tick).
- **drag** — a fast yank across the taskbar (Phase 2) startles; a slow drag doesn't.
Each is small and trust-damped, so a bonded/bold cat barely reacts and a new/shy one
is more skittish. Tunables sit near `DRIFT`/`URGENT` (`brain.py`) and the trigger
amounts in `taskbar_mascot_cat.py`.

## 2. Memory / voice brain — `chatter.py`

Events: `pet, fed, consoled, claude_success/failure/question/done,
wants_attention, hungry, scared, musing, wake, sleep, greet`. Each is tagged with
context (`drives()` + `behavior`) and turned into a line.

### Self-improving loop (the core)
For each event:
```
ctx_coverage = neighbours_for_event(struct_sim ≥ 0.60) / COVER_CAP     # M3
local_prob   = clamp(0.10 + 0.55·ctx_coverage + 0.45·budget_pressure, 0, 0.95)
```
`random() < local_prob` → answer **from memory** (free, offline). Else → call the
LLM **and learn the reply** — but coverage is **context-aware (M3)**, so an API
call is spent to *fill the current gap*, not pile near-dups onto common contexts.
API use trends toward zero as the space fills.

### Structured recall (M1) — flagged `RECALL_MODE = "structured" | "vector"`
Context is a typed dict: `{event, mood, behavior, energy_b, hunger_b, fear_b,
affection_tier, daypart, claude_streak}`. Similarity = weighted field match
(`FIELD_WEIGHTS`; ordinal buckets score 1.0 equal / 0.5 adjacent / 0.0 opposite),
normalized 0..1. Interpretable, collision-free, zero-dep. Legacy hashed-cosine
("vector") retained as fallback. Event is always a hard filter.

### Maturity-weighted local use (M8)
`local_prob = clamp(0.10 + 0.45·ctx_coverage + 0.30·pool_maturity + 0.30·budget_pressure)`
with `pool_maturity = min(lines_for_event, LINE_CAP)/LINE_CAP`, plus a per-event
floor (`LOCAL_FLOOR`: musing/greet 0.6, wake/sleep 0.5). Earlier the policy stayed
API-bound — per-context coverage alone rarely crossed threshold, so accumulated
memory went unused. Maturity makes a filled pool actually get recalled. A served
**repeat** also nudges that line's reward toward 0.3 (`REPEAT_PENALTY`) so eviction
drops over-served lines, and the anti-repeat ring is 16. Verified in `sim_harness.py`:
local_hit_rate ~0.22 → ~0.61, late-hit ~0.22 → ~0.75, API calls roughly halved, no
repeat/sim/reward regression.

### Reward-weighted recall (M2)
Each line carries `{reward, uses, last_used}`. The mascot reports outcomes within
the interaction (pet/feed/console → 1.0, scare → 0.0); reward is EWMA (α=0.25).
```
recall_weight = (sim + 0.05)³ · (0.5 + reward) · anti_repeat · cross_mult
```
- **anti_repeat (M5):** ×0.15 for lines in a session ring of the last 8 served.
- **cross_mult (M7):** when the context is thin (< MIN_KEEP neighbours), borrow
  lines from compatible events (`COMPAT_EVENTS`) at ×0.5.
Sample from the top half, weighted. So she serves lines that *land* and *fit*.

### Eviction (M4)
Over `LINE_CAP=24`, drop the worst by
`keep = 0.5·reward + 0.3·diversity + 0.2·recency` (diversity = mean text-dissimilarity),
never below `MIN_KEEP=6`. Keeps high-performing, distinct lines.

### Voice-coherent prompts (M6)
LLM calls include her top-reward lines for the event as few-shot "her voice",
current facts, the context, and the MAX_LINE/ASCII constraints — so new lines stay
on-voice and pass the quality gate.

### Get-to-know-you quiz (C) — she asks, you click, she adapts
When idle and comfortable (`affection ≥ QUIZ_MIN_AFFECTION`, `QUIZ_COOLDOWN`
between asks, lifetime cap `QUIZ_MAX`), Tabby poses a short question with 2–3
clickable answers (UI `QuestionBubble`). Questions are **API-generated for
uniqueness** when online (`_llm_question`, parsed from `question | opt | opt`);
offline / out of budget the strong fallback is the **tagged
`questions_library.json`** (200+ items) via `_pick_library_q`, which tracks used
ids through the `user_profile` keyset so nothing repeats until the bank is
exhausted. Answered API questions are appended to `learned_questions.json`
(deduped, capped) for offline reuse. The answer is stored in `user_profile`
(`q_id → {q, a, ts, prefs}`), crystallized as a fact (the option's tagged `fact`
if present), and — for options carrying `traits` — nudges her own personality
(`TRAIT_NUDGE`, bounded). Structured `prefs` are read **directly** by
`behavior_hints` (keyword `_pref_extract` is only the fallback for untagged API
questions), so offline answers are lossless. `user_profile` feeds the system
prompt and `quiet_factor()`. All on the worker thread;
`maybe_ask`/`poll_question`/`answer_question` mirror the say/poll pattern.

### Bond decay (Phase 1b) — the bond can cool
Affection is no longer monotonic. A real attention event (pet/feed/console/quiz)
stamps `last_attention` (and only those events — `save()` rewrites `last_seen`,
never `last_attention`). `_decay_bond()` runs on load and on a 60s worker tick:
after `BOND_GRACE_H` (~10h) of neglect she loses `BOND_DECAY_PER_DAY` (~4/day)
scaled by the neglected time, **loyalty-damped** (`rate·(1−0.30·tier_frac)`, higher
tiers cool slower) and floored at `BOND_FLOOR=25` (≥ the quiz gate, so neglect
can't silently disable quizzing). It's wall-clock based, so it works across
restarts and while the app is closed. `idle_hours()` exposes the gap (also used by
the Phase-4 neglect trigger). Bond changes emit a telemetry `bond` event.

### Reflection → confidence facts (R1/R2)
Every ~8 interactions one LLM call distils recent observations into a
`category|fact`. Facts are **records** `{text, category, evidence, confidence,
last_seen}` over categories `tools/schedule/temperament/style`. Re-observation
raises evidence + confidence (EWMA 0.30); confidence **decays with age** and facts
**drop below 0.20**; capped 3/category; near-dups merged. The prompt uses the
top-confidence facts. Reflection is skipped under budget pressure (R2).

### Quality guardrails
- **`_clean_line`** — printable-ASCII only (kills mojibake/emoji), single line,
  ≤ `MAX_LINE=46` at a word boundary, must contain letters.
- **Dedup** (text cosine > 0.8) on store + load.
- **Self-heal on load** — re-clean + de-dup + migrate fields.
- **UTF-8 everywhere**, **atomic writes** (temp + `os.replace`).
- **Daily budget** `DAILY_BUDGET=600` (Groq free = 1000), reflection counts too.
- **Canned fallback** when no key / offline. **Background worker** for all network
  (RLock: build prompt under lock, network outside, store under lock).

### Telemetry (P2) — `cat_metrics.json`
Per day: served, api, reflection, local_hits, local_hit_rate, avg_served_sim,
mean_served_reward, repeat_rate, plus **local_question_rate** (library vs API
quiz questions), **offline_flips** (online↔offline transitions), and **affection**
(bond trajectory). Atomic, worker-thread only. The sim harness reads the same
metrics; the dashboard adds offline-self-sufficiency + bond-trajectory cards.

### Event telemetry (Phase 0) — `Cat.log_event`
A separate, in-memory bounded ring of `{ts, kind, …}` events (`bond`/`fear`/`net`)
following the field contract in `docs/MONITORING.md`. For now it writes nothing to
disk — the Phase-6 monitor will swap the body for a rotating `cat_telemetry.jsonl`.
Producers (bond decay, fear triggers, the online flag) already emit them.

## 3. Persistence (separate files, schema-versioned)

| file | holds | churn | gitignored |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| `cat_state.json` | personality: affection, **last_attention**, traits, **confidence facts**, **user_profile (w/ structured prefs)**, mood, interactions, persisted **drives + valence/arousal + affinity + trust + jumpiness + active_hours**, `schema_version` | slow | yes |
| `cat_brain.json` | learned `lines` (line, ctx, **cstruct, reward, uses, last_used**), daily `calls`, `schema_version` | fast | yes |
| `cat_metrics.json` | daily telemetry | fast | yes |
| `questions_library.json` | 200+ tagged quiz questions | static | **no (tracked)** |
| `learned_questions.json` | API-grown quiz questions for offline reuse | slow | yes |
| `.env` / `cat_config.json` | API key / base_url / model | rare | yes |

`schema_version=4`; `migrate`/self-heal on load adds new fields with safe defaults
(e.g. `last_attention` seeds to now) and never loses data. Drives + learning
persist every 30s and on quit.

---

## 3.5 Cross-brain wiring (X-series)

The two brains stay decoupled — `brain.py` never imports or calls `chatter`. The
**mascot orchestrates** via one read surface + one write surface, plus an activity
feed:

```
chatter.behavior_hints() ──pull──► mascot ──apply_hints()──► brain   (learned -> behaviour)
mascot Claude transitions ─────────────────► brain.note_activity()    (rhythm from coding)
```

- **`chatter.Cat.behavior_hints()` (1a, X1)** — lock-held, network-free. Returns
  `{traits, prefs{chattiness, comfort_style, chronotype, pace}, schedule_conf}`.
  Prefs are distilled from `user_profile` quiz answers by `_pref_extract` keyword
  maps (answer text decisive, question text fills gaps, later `ts` overrides).
  Neutral on cold start; tolerant of malformed records. Intentionally lossy.
- **`brain.Brain.apply_hints(hints)` (1b, X3)** — UI-thread, no lock. Precomputes
  bounded `[0.6, 1.6]` per-behaviour multipliers from `TRAIT_EFFECTS`
  (playfulness→play/zoomies/wander/happy, curiosity→curious/watch/ponder/think,
  shyness→+loaf/sit/sleep −zoomies/play, sass→grumpy), folded into `_choose`.
  `scare` softens ×0.6 for `comfort_style=="space"` and amplifies slightly with
  shyness. `apply_hints({})` is a perfect neutral identity.
- **`note_activity(weight, now, hour)` (1c, X4)** — replaces the old inline
  `active_hours[h]+=1`. Lazily decays the whole histogram by `RHYTHM_DECAY**days`
  before bumping (`_rhythm_last_ts` persisted; missing key → now, no upgrade
  decay). Called from feed/pet AND from the mascot's `tool_success/failure/
  question/done` transitions, so coding rhythm is learned from coding.
- **Prediction + anticipation (1d, X5/X6)** — `active_curve()` (normalised),
  `predicted_active()` (≥0.5 of peak, needs `RHYTHM_MIN_SAMPLES`),
  `pre_active()` (a predicted hour within `PRE_ACTIVE_HOURS` ahead, not yet
  active). `_choose` returns the drive-only `anticipate` behaviour before your
  usual hours and suppresses `sleep`/`loaf` while you usually code. Cold start →
  no prediction, no false anticipation.

Hints are refreshed on the ~30s persist cadence and right after a quiz answer —
never per tick (it takes the chatter lock). Verified by `sim_harness.py` X12.

---

## 4. Verifying changes — `sim_harness.py` (M0)

```
python sim_harness.py [N]      # default 1000, offline, LLM stubbed, no budget
```
Streams synthetic events, prints a before/after table for `RECALL_MODE`
vector vs structured: local_hit_rate, early/late hit (learning curve),
avg_served_sim, reward, repeat_rate, api_calls, lines. Run it before/after any
memory change; **don't regress**.

Current baseline (1000 events): structured beats vector — `local_hit_rate`
~0.22 vs ~0.16, `avg_served_sim` ~0.64 vs ~0.57, `repeat_rate` ≈ 0, fewer API calls,
rising learning curve, no drive runaway over a 30-min behaviour sim.

---

## One-line summary
**Drives (smoothed into mood) + event form a typed context → context recalls the
best-fitting, best-performing learned line or spends a budgeted API call to fill a
gap → outcomes score lines, reflection distils confidence facts, behaviour affinity
and trust adapt to you → everything persists.** Her learned traits + quiz prefs
also bias what she *does* (`behavior_hints → apply_hints`), and her decaying
activity rhythm lets her **anticipate** your coding sessions (`note_activity`,
`pre_active`). She behaves autonomously, speaks in context, learns you, acts on
what she's learned, and needs the cloud less the longer she lives.
